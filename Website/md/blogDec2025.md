# Last night's test for multiple markdown files

**Date:** 2025-11-25 **Tags:** markdown, javascript

## So I had to further adjust the parser

I had to adjust the parser to handle the new files like the original blog.md
file:

```JavaScript
const raw = fs.readFileSync(path.join(blogDir, file), "utf8");

const normalizedRaw = raw.replace(/\r\n/g, "\n").replace(/\r/g, "\n");
```

Then:

```JavaScript
const normalized = normalizedRaw.replace(
  /(\*\*Date:\*\*.*?)(\s+)(\*\*Tags:\*\*.*)/g,
  "$1\n$3"
);
```

So this removed the carraige return \r that were causing the blog cards to look
weird with lots of spacing between lines.
